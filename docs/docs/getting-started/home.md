## What is Kentan?

Kentan allows you to create, organize and compose test data.
Once this is done it simplifies your test arrangements.
Kentan is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and provides typed `Factories` and `Builders` to create reusable test data.

The Kentan library can be used with any test framework you know ([Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), etc).

?> The goal of Kentan is to support you writing readable and maintainable tests.

See the [Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start.md) for more details.
